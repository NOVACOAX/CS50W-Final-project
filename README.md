# MAgPIE Movies
#### Video Demo:  [YouTube Demo](https://youtu.be/aWiMzbAd4l0)
#### Description: Hello Wolrd from kenya.:kenya: For my CS50 Web-development final project, I made a responsive movie review website that gets live data from [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com) using [PyMovieDb](https://github.com/itsmehemant7/PyMovieDb) API and displays it in a pleasing format. There is a secured login system in place.

### Distinctiveness and Complexity:
This  project is purely distinct from any other project previously submitted in `CS50W` and `CS50X` including `social network` from project 4 `e-commerce` from project 2.
MAgPIE movies makes use of the user authentication provided by Django and one more model, `Watchlist` to give its users the bestg experience. 
Searching for movies and saving/deleting a movie from the watchlist is done entirely through javascript fetch.
The Web applistion is responsive to differnt screen sizes and the contents are perfectly framed for the best user experince.

### Languages used:
  - Pyhthon
  - python -> Django
  - JavaScript
  - jQuery
  - HTML/CSS

### Resources:
  - [PyMovieDb](https://github.com/itsmehemant7/PyMovieDb) is a python wrapper to represent the [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com) API. It helps you to get files i.e.   Movies/TV-Series information from IMDB by scraping.
